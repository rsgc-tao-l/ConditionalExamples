 ## Colour
 
 For details on how colour works when programming in Swift, [review the following PDF file](http://russellgordon.ca/rsgc/2016-17/ics2o/HSB_Colour_Model_-_Summary_-_Swift_3.pdf).
 
 To summarize:
 * hue: the "shade" of the colour
 * saturation: colour intensity
 * brightness: colour brightness
 
 This is best explored interactively by [downloading and running this program](http://russellgordon.ca/rsgc/ics/c3d.zip).
 ### Complementary colour
 Complementary colours are across from each other on the colour wheel.
 
 ![complementary](complementary-colour.png "Complementary colour")
 
 The HSB colour model makes it very easy to program colour changes.
 
 In this example:
 
 * a random hue between 0 and 360 degrees is selected
 * the hue across the colour wheel is found by adding 180 degrees
 * if the hue has become greater than 360, we then find the remainder when dividing by 360 degrees (since a hue must be between 0 and 360)
 * a random width and height is set for the inner square
 * a rectangle for each of the complementary colours is created
 
 Try running the program several times to see how a conditional statement and random number generation is used to produce interesting output.

// Adjust complementary colour to be between 0 and 360 (if needed)
if complement > 360 {
    complement = Float(Int(complement) % 360)

// Get random width and height for the inner square (between 50 and 150)
let dimension = Int(arc4random_uniform(100)) + 50

// Get the inset for the inner square
let inset = x + (200 * y - dimension) / 2

// Draw the inner square
canvas.fillColor = Color(hue: complement, saturation: 80, brightness: 90, alpha: 100)
canvas.drawRectangle(bottomLeftX: inset, bottomLeftY: inset, width: dimension, height: dimension)
